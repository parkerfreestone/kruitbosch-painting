                Many people only focus on interior of home. Getting the right
                exterior sets the tone for the interior. Think about that
                beautiful entry door â€“ and spicing it up with a gel stain, being
                daring with a Tricorn Black color. Pergolas and Exterior timbers
                create a great outdoor space for gatherings. Create an outdoor
                cooking kitchen area with rough sawn timbers. Even class up your
                outdoor space by creating living walls to make your exterior
                space more private.
